Capsule Shooter

Description
Capsue Shooter is a simple shooter game where you control the purple cube character. Try to shoot the red targets to destroy them. Avoid hitting the yellow targets; they will fall over pathetically (sad!).

Controls
Move - WASD
Rotate Camera - Move mouse left/right
Shoot - Space Bar

How to Play
Use the controls to move and shoot the targets. Hit red targets before they disappear and avoid shooting yellow targets. There's no penalty or score system unfortunately, but that's the rules.

All assets used are default assets from Unity.
